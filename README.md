Small programs created by me for university in which I learned and test: <br/>
-> OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation, composition, implementing and creating interfaces, abstract classes, static vs nonstatic methods, constructors) <br/>
-> Exceptions handling <br/>
-> Working with input/output streams (binary/text files, input/output binary or text streams) <br/>
-> Serialization,Deserialization mechanisms (ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream) <br/>
-> Java collections (ArrayList, TreeSet, HashMaps) <br/>
