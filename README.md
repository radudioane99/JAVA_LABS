Small programs created by me for university in which I learned and test:
-> OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation, composition, implementing and creating interfaces, abstract classes, static vs nonstatic methods, constructors)
-> Exceptions handling
-> Working with input/output streams (binary/text files, input/output binary or text streams)
-> Serialization,Deserialization mechanisms (ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream)
-> Java collections (ArrayList, TreeSet, HashMaps)
